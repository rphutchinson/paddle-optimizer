# Paddle Optimizer (working title)

## Decription
Determines optimal times and locations for kayaking or paddle boarding given some inputs and environmental factors

Given a single hardcoded "route" determine optimal times in the next week based on weather (wind speed and temperature) and tide. The implementation will use TypeScript and will have a GraphQL interface.

## Purpose
Mainly I'm building this as a means to learn TypeScript and GraphQL. I'm hopeful that it'll also be something that I get some real use out of
